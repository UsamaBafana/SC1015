# SC1015 Data Science Project - **Suicide Rates**
----------------
## About
Our team's objective is to reduce the number of suicide rates by understanding what factor(s) contribute to the large number of suicide rate from [Dataset]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronaldonyango/global-suicide-rates-1990-to-2022).

## Problem Definition
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  What **socioeconomic factors** might be behind the suicide rates in the world?


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Which model is best used to predict death rate?
----
## 5 Models were used:
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision tree Regression
3. Polynomial Regression
4. Random Forest Regression
5. Gradient Boosting Regression
-----
## Conclusion
Male suicide rates are higher than females.
Concluded to disregard female data for and used maleâ€™s STDDeathRate in Europe for our machine learning.
Best models to use for predicting StdDeathRate using GNIPerCapita is:
Linear Regression (Best)
Polynomial Regression (Best)
Followed by Decision Tree > Gradient Boosting > Random Forest
